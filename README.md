githubmodel folder houses the trained model, (last-model ) is the most effective one, according to spacy, this trained model achieves 93 percent accuracy on validation data set.
Its prediction power and ability to gather new words thats not already present in the databasse is weak. Will look into how to optimise training process( word vectors.. drop out rate..e.e)
That being said, overall success rate is still pretty good.
I will optimise the rule based model first to increase accuracy and then attmept to retrain, but in the meantime, both models are avalable for any further testing. 


Entitiy training moel NER is the rule based model and github last model  is the machine learning model.

The csv generated by the rule based model is attached here, for some reason I failed to upload the file to github despite using the large file system recommended, but google drive works.
